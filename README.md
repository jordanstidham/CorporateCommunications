PROJECT DESCRIPTION								
The success stories program highlights the success of Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) participants, mentors, and alumni in their programs, shining the spotlight on their host and sponsor agencies. Success stories illustrate how current and previous research participants have taken an active role in world-class science. Many of these internship, fellowship, and research appointments shaped their futures and professional goals. These stories are published on the corporate website (https://orise.orau.gov/), promoted on the mobile application, and featured on the company's social media to enhance business development. The corportate website attracts 7,000 users daily and the multiple social media platforms reach a combined 11,500 users. I have written 22 stories for the program, all in Associated Press (AP) style, and 7 of them are live links online. My stories have been used to promote exceptional scientific researchers, gain program exposure, and they are being used in recruiting and outreach efforts including: tabletops, fliers, and brochures. The stories are also featured in the companyâ€™s annual report.
